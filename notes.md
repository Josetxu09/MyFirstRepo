Welcome.<br>
My name is Jose, and i study on the IES San Vicente.<br>
My hobbies are playing videogames, going out with friends, watch videos...<br>
My interests include finishing the grade i´m studying, start to live by myself, maybe adopt a cat... and many more that i´ll not write here ´cause this´ll get long.<br>
Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
